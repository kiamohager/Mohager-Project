# Kia Mohager - Personal Website with 3D Audio Visualizer

## Overview

This project uses a sample song to generate a 3D sine wave animation, where the wave's amplitude dynamically adjusts in response to changes in the audio's frequency. The visualization is designed to reflect the spikes in the audio frequency spectrum, creating an immersive, real-time representation of the music.

## Features

Audio Analysis: Extracts key frequency data from a sample song to detect spikes in amplitude.

3D Visualization: Generates a 3D sine wave animation that reacts in real-time to the changes in audio frequency.

Dynamic Amplitude: The amplitude of the sine wave increases at points where the audio experiences frequency spikes, giving a visual cue to the music's intensity.

Real-time Rendering: The animation continuously updates in sync with the music, offering a seamless visual experience.

## Coming Soon

Integration with Spotify's API to allow the client to play any song of their choosing.
